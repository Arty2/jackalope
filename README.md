The application draws from several related Wikipedia entries in English and Greek: Hybrid_arts; Computer_art; New_media_art; Relational_art; Participatory_art; Hybrid_(biology); Postinternet; Alternate_reality_game; Hypermedia; Free_software_movement; Data_mining; Actor–network_theory; Cybernetics; Posthumanism; Cyberfeminism; Cyberpunk; Circuit_bending; Databending; Map–territory_relation; Information_theory. When a term doesn’t have a translation in the Greek version of Wikipedia, a short translated summary is displayed instead. The application’s code and several curated excerpts from prominent theorists run across the display.
